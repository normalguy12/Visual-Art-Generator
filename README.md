This used to be a Capstone Project for my graduation, however, I decided to transform it and make it available to everyone who is interested in making visual pieces.

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
