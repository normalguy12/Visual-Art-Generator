This used to be a Capstone Project for my graduation, however, I decided to transform it and introduce to everyone who is interested in making visual pieces. The Visual Art Generator is built 100% by JavaScript and other external libraries. It is still under construction, therefore, I am looking forward to working with visual artists and developers to make it a method to render 3D visuals on the web-based site.

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
